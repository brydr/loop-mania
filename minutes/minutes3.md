## Comments:
Timeline complete
user stories mostly complete\
UI looking good need to add some changes\
<b>Assumptions need to be precise, but we can change later</b>\
eg. slug has battle radius of 1 and support radius of 1\
<b>More precision needed in user story acceptance criteria:</b>\
small chance -> 0.5 chance\
drops gold -> drops 100 gold?\
<b>3 levels of priority for user stories:</b>
1. essential
2. in spec but doesn't need to be in mvp
3. extensions\

<b>UI Updates to be completed:</b>\
Have friendly soldiers with a counter instead of the tiles for each soldier\
Goal has one checkbox if the condition is gold OR experience\
Highlight completed condition green?\
Soldiers animated behind character or some other representation on the map\
Hover over health bar to show detail about specific amount of health ie. 50/100\
Battle result screen in place of battle window for our mvp
