## Comments:
Should assumptions be implementation based ie random will be done with normal distribution\
or should they be behaviour based, ie expect certain input from user\
Look in gitlab issues for our user stories, most our epic stories have been made and need user stories to go with them\
Need to add priority tags to stories\
Dongzhu will work on UI tonight\
We need to write tests before implementation for milestone 2
